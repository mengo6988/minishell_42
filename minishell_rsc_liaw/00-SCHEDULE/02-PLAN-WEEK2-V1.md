## [MON] UNSERSTANDING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
### (MORNING) RESEARCH AND CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING
- Learning Material			: Read about environment variables in Unix systems on websites like [The Linux Documentation Project](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/environment.html) and [GNU Bash Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Environment).
### (NOON) BASIC IMPLEMENTATION
- Learning Material			: Watch online tutorials on C programming and environment variables on platforms like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).

### (EVENIN) DEBUGGING AND TESTING
- Learning Material			: Explore debugging techniques in C using resources like [GDB Tutorial](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/pointers/gdbQS.html).
- Practical Exercise		: Debug your Minishell's environment variable handling using GDB.

## [TUE] ADVANCED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE HANDLING
### (MORNING) HANDLING MORE COMPLEX SCENARIOS
- Learning Material			: Read about advanced environment variable handling in C from [Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Programming-UNIX-Environment-3rd/dp/0321637739).
- Practical Exercise		: Implement advanced scenarios like modifying and deleting variables.
### (NOON) ADVANCED IMPLEMENTATION
- Learning Material			: Explore error handling in C with resources like [C Error Handling](https://www.learn-c.org/error-handling-in-c/).
- Practical Exercise		: Implement error handling for advanced environment variable scenarios.
### (EVENIN) THOROUGH TESTING
- Learning Material			: Understand testing strategies in C using resources like [C Unit Testing with Check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/).
- Practical Exercise		: Write unit tests for your environment variable functions using Check.

## [WED] INTRODUCTION TO FORKING AND PROCESSES
### (MORNING) LEARNING FORK()
- Learning Material			: Read about the fork() system call on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/).
- Practical Exercise		: Write a simple C program using fork() to understand parent-child processes.
### (NOON) BASIC PROCESS CREATION
- Learning Material			: Watch tutorials on process creation in C on platforms like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
- Practical Exercise		: Modify your Minishell to create a new process using fork().
### (EVENIN) TESTING PROCESS CREATION
- Learning Material			: Learn about C process execution with [exec functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Executing-a-File.html).
- Practical Exercise		: Test process creation and execution in your Minishell.

## [THU] MANAGING MULTIPLE PROCESSES
### (MORNING) UNDERSTANDING PROCESS MANAGEMENT
- Learning Material			: Study process management basics from [Operating System Concepts](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/index.html).
- Practical Exercise		: Outline how your Minishell will manage multiple processes.
### (NOON) CONCURRENT PROCESS EXECUTION
- Learning Material			: Explore job control in Unix-like systems with [Job Control in Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Job-Control.html).
- Practical Exercise		: Implement basic job control features in your Minishell.
### (EVENIN) THOROUGH TESTING AND DEBUGGING
- Learning Material			: Learn about debugging multi-process programs using [GDB](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/).
- Practical Exercise		: Debug your Minishell with multiple concurrently executing processes.

## [FRI] COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PROCESSES
### (MORNING) INTER-PROCESS COMMUNICATION (IPC)
- Learning Material			: Read about IPC mechanisms in C from [Interprocess Communication in Unix](https://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/CE.html).
- Practical Exercise		: Understand basic IPC mechanisms like pipes and shared memory.
### (NOON) BASIC IPC IMPLEMENTATION
- Learning Material			: Watch tutorials on IPC in C on platforms like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
- Practical Exercise		: Implement basic communication between processes in your Minishell.
### (EVENIN) TESTING AND REFINEMENT
- Learning Material			: Explore advanced IPC mechanisms like message queues with [Message Queues in Unix](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node104.html).
- Practical Exercise		: Test and refine your Minishell's IPC features.
