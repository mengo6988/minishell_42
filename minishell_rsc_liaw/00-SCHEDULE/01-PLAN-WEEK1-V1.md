## [TUES] Basic Tokenization
### Learning Objectives:
- Understand the concept of tokenization.
- Recognize the importance of breaking user input into tokens.

### Tasks:
1. **Review Tokenization:**
   - Understand what tokenization is and why it is essential in parsing.
   - Learn about different types of tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.

2. **Write a Basic Tokenizer:**
   - Create a function in C that takes a string as input and breaks it into tokens.
   - Handle basic cases like space-separated tokens.

3. **Test the Tokenizer:**
   - Write a simple program to test the tokenizer with various inputs.
   - Ensure it correctly identifies and separates tokens.

## [WED] Parsing Simple Commands
### Learning Objectives:
- Understand the structure of a simple command.
- Learn to parse and represent simple commands in a data structure.

#### Tasks:
1. **Define Data Structure:**
   - Decide on a data structure to represent a parsed command.
   - Include fields for the command name, arguments, and any other relevant information.

2. **Implement Command Parsing:**
   - Write a parser function that takes the tokens from the tokenizer and constructs a command structure.
   - Handle cases like commands with arguments.

3. **Test the Parser:**
   - Create a program that uses the tokenizer and parser to process user input.
   - Test with various commands and ensure the correct construction of the command structure.

## [THU] Handling Input/Output Redirection
### Learning Objectives:
- Understand how input/output redirection works.
- Extend the parser to recognize and handle redirection.

#### Tasks:
1. **Learn about Redirection:**
   - Read about input/output redirection in Unix-like systems.
   - Understand the concepts of stdin, stdout, and stderr.

2. **Extend the Data Structure:**
   - Modify the command structure to include fields for input/output files.

3. **Implement Redirection Parsing:**
   - Update the parser to recognize and handle input/output redirection.
   - Validate the correctness of redirection syntax.

4. **Test Redirection:**
   - Create test cases that involve input/output redirection.
   - Ensure the parser correctly identifies and handles redirection in commands.

## [FRI] Advanced Parsing Concepts
#### Learning Objectives:
- Explore advanced parsing concepts for more complex command structures.
- Understand how to handle special characters and quotes.

#### Tasks:
1. **Special Characters:**
   - Learn about special characters in Unix commands (e.g., `*`, `?`, `~`).
   - Modify the tokenizer and parser to handle special characters appropriately.

2. **Quotes and Escaping:**
   - Understand the role of quotes and escaping in command-line input.
   - Enhance the tokenizer and parser to handle quoted strings and escaping characters.

3. **Implement Advanced Parsing:**
   - Extend the parser to handle more complex command structures involving special characters and quotes.

4. **Test Advanced Parsing:**
   - Create test cases that involve special characters, quotes, and escaping.
   - Ensure the parser handles complex command structures correctly.

## [SAT] Error Handling and Refinement
### Learning Objectives:
- Implement robust error handling in the parsing module.
- Refine the parser for better performance and usability.

### Tasks:
1. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling mechanisms in the parser.
   - Clearly communicate errors to the user for better debugging.

2. **Refine the Parser:**
   - Review the parser code for potential improvements.
   - Optimize the code for better performance and readability.

3. **Test Error Cases:**
   - Create test cases that intentionally introduce errors.
   - Verify that the parser correctly identifies and reports errors.

4. **Code Review (Optional):**
   - If possible, seek feedback from peers or mentors.
   - Perform a self-code review to identify areas for improvement.

### Conclusion:
By the end of these steps;
-   solid understanding of tokenization,
-   parsing simple and complex commands,
-   handling input/output redirection,
-   implementing error handling in the parsing module.
